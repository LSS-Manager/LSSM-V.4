        text: `Dear LSSM-User,<br>
unfortunately your LSSM V.4 userscript is outdated. In the latest version changes have been made to the userscript, which are important for the function of LSSM V.4.<br>
You need at least version {minVersion}, the update can be done comfortably by clicking on {updateLink}.<br>
Sometimes the update does not work by clicking the link (for unknown reasons). Then you can either trigger an update within Tampermonkey (click on the tampermonkey icon in your browser, then "Overview". Check the box in front of the LSSM userscript and select "Update" as action.<br>
If that also does not work, edit the LSSM Script within Tampermonkey by replacing all script content with the content of {bypassLink}.<br>
Sometimes, LSSM is installed multiple times after an update. In this case it helps to uninstall/remove all LSSM V.4 installations in Tampermonkey and then reinstall LSSM V.4 once.<br><br>
Kind regards,<br>
your LSSM team`,

A lot has happened this year, of course, and so on this special occasion we would like to say a special thank you to you, the users. The joy with which you test our new features inspires us again and again and gives us new motivation to continue. Also, a big thank you goes out to our translators who volunteer their time to make the LSSM usable in other versions of the game.</br>To celebrate, we\'d like to share a few facts and figures here:<ul><li><code>February 10th 2020</code>: The First Commit on GitHub was made: <a href="https://github.com/LSS-Manager/LSSM-V.4/commit/6e95836" target="_blank">6e95836</a>.
