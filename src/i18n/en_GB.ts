Sometimes the update does not work by clicking the link (for unknown reasons). Then you can either trigger an update within Tampermonkey (click on the tampermonkey icon in your browser, then "Overview". Check the box in front of the LSSM userscript and select "Update" as action.<br>
If that also does not work, edit the LSSM Script within Tampermonkey by replacing all script content with the content of {bypassLink}.<br>
Sometimes, LSSM is installed multiple times after an update. In this case, please delete the script that does not have version 4.5.10 (in Tampermonkey).<br>
We're sorry for any caused issue if updates did not work correctly.
