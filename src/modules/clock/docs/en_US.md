This module allows you to see a customisable clock within the game.
There are a lot of different settings you can use in order to customise this to your liking.
You can find help on configuration under [Settings: Moment.js](../../settings.md#moment-js).

The clock can be placed in two locations:

* On the left of the navigation bar
    ![Clock in the Navigation Bar](assets/en_US/navbar.png)

The format in the above images is `DD[th] MMM YYYY LTS`.

## Configuration
