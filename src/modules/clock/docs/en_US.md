This module allows you to see a customisable clock within the game. There are a lot of different settings you can use in order to customise this to your liking. You can find help on configuration under [Settings: Moment.js](../../settings.md#moment-js).

The clock can be placed in two locations:
* On the left of the navigation bar
  ![Clock in the Navigation Bar](./navbar.png)
* As an overlay
  ![Clock as an Overlay Over Chat](./chatOverlay.png)

The format in the above images is `DD[th] MMM YYYY LTS`.

## Configuration

For configuration information, please see [Settings: Moment.js](../../settings.md#moment-js).
