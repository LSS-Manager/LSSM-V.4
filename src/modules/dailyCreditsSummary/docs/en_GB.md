This module replaces the `Total for the daily summary` in V3, which showed in your [daily summary](https://www.missionchief.co.uk/credits/daily) how much you earned for each category (for example transporting patients).

This module has been spiced up a bit for V4.

There are the "badges" displayed by default (these can be turned off in settings):

If you click on the little `i`, then you will be shown a sortable table:
