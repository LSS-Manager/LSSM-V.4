Over time this module will provide some useful features for chat. There is currently only one feature for this module, but more will come soon.

## Adjust Timestamp In chat

This feature allows you to adjust the timestamp in the chat to whatever you want it to be instead of the standard format `[hour:minute]`. You could change it to `[Day hour:minute:second]`. You can find information about how to customise the time on the [clock module page](clock.md#Configuration).
