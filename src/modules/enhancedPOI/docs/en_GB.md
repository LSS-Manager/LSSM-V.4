Setting POIs is required for some missions such as `Large Aircraft Crash Off Airport` to spawn.
If you wish to not use other people's POIs, you will need to set your own.
This module allows you to set POIs easier.

* All POIs of the selected type are highlighted
    * The highlight colour can be changed in the settings.
* If the marker leaves the area of the visible map, the marker will be set back to the centre of the map.
* You can show and hide each POI type
    * This can be controlled when you open the `Set a new POI` menu
