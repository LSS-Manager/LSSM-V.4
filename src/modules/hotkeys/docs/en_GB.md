In this game, certain actions are repeated over and over again. By using this module, you can perform these actions with simple key presses, meaning you don't have to use the mouse.

::: warning Default Combinations
All browsers already have built-in hotkeys for their own functions. (e.g. `CTRL+S` to save a page or `CTRL+O` open a file). We currently do NOT overwrite these standard hotkeys ! So if you set an LSSM functionality `CTRL+O`, the "Open file" dialog of your browser will also open.

## Hotkeys

You can set hotkeys to individual keys (eg. `U`), to combinations of keys (eg. `CTRL+U`), or keys in a row (eg. `U D`). Upper/Lower case is not accounted for.

To set a hotkey, go into the settings for hotkeys, and press the `+` icon.

There you select an action, and the hotkey for that action.

## View Hotkeys

By pressing the `F1` key at any time, you can see your hotkeys.
