### Buildings

If you click on a category in the building overview (eg `Fire Department`), buildings from the respective category are shown.

If you then click on a building type, an overview of the number of vehicles that are in those buildings will be displayed.

### Vehicles

If you click on a group of vehicles (eg `HART`) in the vehicle overview, it will only show vehicle types from this group.

## Status Overview

In the status overview you will see your vehicle type, amount and how many are in each status.
