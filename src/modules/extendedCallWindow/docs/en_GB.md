### ARR Counters
This counts the amount of times you've clicked on a specific ARR for this mission. There is an additional setting to display this in a red circle on the ARR.

### Mark Clicked ARR
This will add a border around the ARR. The colour and the thickness of the frame is customisable.

### Unsuitable ARRs
This will place a grey filter on ARRs that do not match the name of the mission.

### Hover on ARR
This will pop up information about that ARR:

* What vehicles will be dispatched
* How many of each vehicle
* The longest response time
* How many times you're able to use this ARR

## Vehicle Categories
This allows you to create your own vehicle categories that will show in the vehicle list section of the dispatch screen. Vehicles can be placed in multiple categories at once, the `ALL` and `Follow Up` categories cannot be deleted, but the other categories can be deleted or modified.
