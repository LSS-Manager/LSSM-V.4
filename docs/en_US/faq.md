# FAQ ❓

### How much does LSS Manager cost?
LSS-Manager is a free extension. - we do not intend to change this.

::: warning Donations
There are a few kind users who would like to donate money to us. Howevever, LSS-Manager is and will remain free of charge. We will not accept any donations for this project.

There are several reasons:
* This project is developed on a voluntary basis in participating developers' spare time.
* A subscription option, similar to the premium in Missionchief would put too much pressure on us to continue programming LSS Manager.
* For legal reasons we cannot accept donations;
    * If we would found a company for LSS Manager so that we could receive donations, there would be no future, because a company without expenses cannot be a company.
    * If we would run the servers, which are currently running LSS Manager, through a company, they would immediately nullify the income.

### How can I contribute to LSS Manager?
The end user can [report bugs][error] or [make suggestions][suggestions].

We are currently designing a style guide for developers, so that they too can easily add their own plugins to LSSM. We have tried to keep our code structure clear and understandable. However, adding a plugin does not in any way imply joining the team.

### How do I report bugs?
Please have a look at our [report bugs][error] page.

### Where can I get support?
Through our support system [here][support].

### How can I submit ideas?
On the [suggestions][suggestions] page.

### Which browsers does LSS Manager work in?
Only desktop browsers are listed here, as mobile browsers are not officially supported.

Since we want to keep the latest coding standards throughout, a modern and up-to-date browser is necessary and recommended - if only for security reasons, even outside the game.
