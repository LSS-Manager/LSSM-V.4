# Committing a file

After you changed a file you need to write a commit message. If you want to make us happy please
use [gitmojis](https://gitmoji.dev) followed by the module name in square brackets and a quick summary (half sentence)
what you changed (eg. translations). Some long module names got unofficial abbreviations over the development.
