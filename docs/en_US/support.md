# Support 👨‍💻

## Guideline
A little aid, which should help you to create a support request.

::: tip
If you need assistance, describe your problem as precisely as possible. The better and more detailed you describe your problem, the faster and better we can help you.
:::
::: warning
Please note that we do not officially support older browsers, mobile browsers and Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer. Support for these browsers is therefore neither guaranteed nor likely.

### 1. Formulate problem
First describe your problem. Include any information that could be important. Also explain what you have already tried.

### 2. Specify user data
Please provide us your username or userId. It is also useful to name the activated modules.

### 3. Report problem
Now you can send us your formulated problem with user data. Use one of the options listed below.

## via Discord
On our <a :href="$themeConfig.variables.discord" target="_blank">Discord</a> you can get support in the channel <a :href="$themeConfig.variables.discord_support" target="_blank">`#support`</a>.

## on GitHub
You may also open an issue on <a :href="$themeConfig.variables.github + '/issues'" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Please check here if an issue for this problem already exists and then follow it up.

## New: Support directly in the game
In order to provide you with even faster and easier support, we have integrated our own support chat. You can access it via LSSM menu in the game. We will do our best to help you as quickly and efficiently as possible, but again, the more detailed you describe your problem from the beginning, the better we can help you!
