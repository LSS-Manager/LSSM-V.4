# Acknowledgements

## Open Source Libraries
LSSM uses public libraries from third parties 

A list of which libraries we use can be found directly in the game in the LSSM menu and is kept up to date.

### The XYRALITY Team
First of all a big thank you goes to the development team of the game. Not only for the game itself, but also for the great help when we have questions.

But also for the numerous aids that make the development of the LSSM easier for us!

### Our Beta Testers
A small group of users are our Beta Testers, getting LSSM features earlier than the general user to test. We do this so we can identify and rectify problems to make LSSM stable for everyone on release.

:::tip
Our Beta Testers program is limited, and we will not add users between application phases. When application phases are open, we will announce this, so everyone has a chance, as long as you meet certain conditions.
:::

### To all who report bugs & make suggestions
Imagine how long a fault in LSSM would exist for if no one reported it - we would certainly not find it so quickly. 
Thank you also for suggestions that keep coming in. The development of LSSM is strongly influenced by the participation and wishes of its users.

### To every single user
Each user always gives us the motivation to keep going and to expand and improve LSSM more and more.
