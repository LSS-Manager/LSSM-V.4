## Open Source Libraries
LSSM of course also uses public libraries from third parties - otherwise some functions would simply be far too much to program.

A list of which libraries we use can be found directly in the game in the LSSM menu and is kept up to date :)

## Acknowledgements
Sometimes we too simply have to say a big thank you!

### The XYRALITY Team
First of all a big thank you goes to the development team of the game. Not only for the game itself, but also for the great help when we have questions.

But also for the numerous aids that make the development of the LSSM easier for us!

### Our beta testers
A small group of active players will get new features earlier than the rest to test them out. So we can find and fix some problems before they are released to everyone.

:::tip
The number of beta testers is limited and no new ones are added "in between". If there is a new application phase, we will announce this accordingly, so that everyone has the chance to become a beta tester - as long as they meet certain conditions.

### All who report bugs and make suggestions
Imagine how long a fault in LSSM would last if no one reported it - we would certainly not find it so quickly. Also the suggestions that keep coming in should not be underestimated. The development of LSSM is strongly influenced by the participation and wishes of its users.

### Every single user
Each user always gives us the motivation to keep going and to expand and improve LSSM more and more.
