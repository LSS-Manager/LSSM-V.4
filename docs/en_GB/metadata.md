# Collection of user metadata

By using the `LSSM` (Leitstellenspiel Manager, extension for the browser) the user accepts that metadata is collected. The following data is stored: `User ID`, `User Name`, `Amount of buildings`, `Currently used Browser`, `Last Call of Script`, `Activated Modules`, `Which local version of the game`, `Which map type is used` & `LSSM Version`.

This data is used to improve the extension as well as a clue for the development of existing or future modules.

**The user can revoke collection of this data at any time by sending a message to one of the developers** All data already collected from the user will be deleted & will not be transferred in the future.
