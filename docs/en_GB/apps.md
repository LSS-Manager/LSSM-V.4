# ℹ️ General information on modules

On the following pages you will find a description of all our modules. We have done our best to keep them as understandable and complete as possible. However, due to the size of LSSM this is not always easy.

If you have suggestions for improvement, you can send them to us as always - or even do it yourself.

## LSSM V.3 vs. LSSM V.4

Below we have listed the features of V.3 and where you can find them in V.4.
We want to integrate all the features of V.3 into V.4 in time!

### Modules only in V3

These Modules will be integrated into V4, but it will still take some time to integrate them.

<v3-v4-comparison-v3only/>
