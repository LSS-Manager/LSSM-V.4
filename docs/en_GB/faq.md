# FAQ ❓

### What does LSS Manager cost?
LSS-Manager is a free offer - we do not intend to change this.

### How can I contribute to LSS Manager?
The end user can [report bugs][error] or [make suggestions][suggestions]. For translations, please refer to our [contribution guide][contributing].

We are currently designing a style guide for developers, so that they too can easily add their own plugins to LSSM. We also tried to keep our code structure clear and understandable. However, adding a plugin does not in any way imply joining the team.

### How do I report bugs?
Please have a look at our [report bugs][error] page.

### Where can I get help?
Through our support. You can find more information [here][support].

### How can I submit ideas?
On the [suggestions][suggestions] page we have put together some information about it.

### In which browsers does LSS Manager work?
Only desktop browsers are listed here, as mobile browsers are not officially supported.

Since we want to keep the latest coding standards throughout, a modern and up-to-date browser is necessary and recommended - if only for security reasons, even outside the game.

<browser-support-table/>

:::danger Internet Explorer and Safari
These two browsers can be described as the "problem children" of a modern web developer. There are some functions that do not work in them, or require additional code.

We don't see the point of doing this everywhere and officially **do not** support these two browsers.

### I want to share my setup with friends or use it on multiple devices. Is that possible?
Yes, it is. Just open the [settings][settings] and click `Export`, to download a config-file. `Import` lets you choose a config-file to import the settings.

### Is there a way to save settings account bound so that you don't have to import them on another device?
Currently we do not offer this, but an implementation of this feature is planned.
