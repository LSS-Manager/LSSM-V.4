# Settings ⚙️

The settings of all modules are managed centrally in the settings. Only the settings of active modules can be changed.

It is planned to add a possibility to export and import the settings as in `LSSM V.3`.
In addition, we would like to offer the possibility to save settings profile-bound in the near future. This means that settings are no longer device-bound.

::: tip Changes
As soon as you exit the settings and have saved changes, the game will reload to easily apply all settings.
If you have unsaved changes, you can't close the settings, you will get a small hint message.

::: danger Reset the settings
Caution: If you reset settings, they cannot be restored without previous export!
