# Appstore :shopping_cart:

The Appstore is a key element of LSS Manager. Within it, you can activate or deactivate modules individually. A brief description of each module will also be provided in the appstore. Via the small blue `i`, you can open the wiki page directly in-game.

::: warning Support of "MapKit" map type.
There are a few modules which do not support MapKit map type. This is because MapKit does not provide some functionality for modules to work. A complete list of these modules can be found at [‚ÑπÔ∏è General information on modules](apps.md).

Due to these Missionchief MapKit restrictions, you can change map type to "OpenStreetMap" for full functionality.
